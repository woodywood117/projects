# projects
This repository is a group of example projects and their initial steps, so that people can create projects that display their coding skills.
This can be useful for people that are looking for toy projects or projects that display their technical skills, but aren't sure how or where to start.
It is meant to give basic direction to junior developers that haven't had any experience with creating tech projects from scratch or are having a hard time coming up with project ideas.

*Currently a work in progress, still brainstorming ideas.*
